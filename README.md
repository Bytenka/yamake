Build tool for C and C++ projects

I was having a hard time with building my C/C++ projects, expecially the big ones.
"make" has being my go to for a long time now, but it is not suitable for a project I'm currently working on.
So I decided to make myself this little program, which goal is to detect changes in source files and rebuild
only what's necessary to save time.
It's like "make", expect you do not have to write subfolders, includes etc.. by hand, it detects them automatically.
Plus you can build in a other folder without getting a headache with make script.
